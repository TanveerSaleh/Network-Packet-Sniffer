Curious about network packet sniffers? These tools are crucial for analyzing and troubleshooting network traffic, providing insights into device communication. Learn how to create a simple network packet sniffer using Python and the Scapy library. 



What is a Network Packet Sniffer? ü§î

A network packet sniffer intercepts and logs network traffic, capturing packets at the data link layer. By analyzing protocol headers, it extracts valuable information like IP addresses, ports, and packet payloads. Used by network administrators, security professionals, and developers, packet sniffers aid in troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and security analysis. 


During a recent project, I delved into Python and deepened my knowledge of packet sniffers. The experience has been enlightening, providing valuable insights into their functionality. Your feedback is crucial to me, so please feel free to reach out with any tool-related concerns. Your understanding and support are greatly appreciated. Thank you!
